# MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow

This project implements a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Built with TensorFlow in Python, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying digits from 0 to 9. The repository includes code for training, testing, and saving the model, as well as loading the model for predictions.

## Features:
- Preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Model architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- Training and evaluation of the model.
- Saved model for reuse and deployment.

Feel free to explore, improve, or use this project as a reference for your own machine learning applications.
