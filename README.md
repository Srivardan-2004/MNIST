# MNIST
This project implements a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. Built with TensorFlow in Python, the model achieves high accuracy in classifying digits from 0 to 9. The repository includes code for training, testing, and saving the model, as well as loading the model for predictions.
